# Fishing_Game
Fishing Game I made for fun!

It's based off of basic concepts of Java. 
You can choose to go to either a pond or a river, and each fish has their own unique percentage of being caught. 
They also have certain percentage of being certain size (randomly generated).
You can also choose to keep or release the fish you caught, and if you decide to keep, they are stored in the fish tank.
You can also manage your fishtank; there's a couple different methods of releasing fish or sort the list of fish.
